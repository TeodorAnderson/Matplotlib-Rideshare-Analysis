Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

## Overview of the analysis:
  I have been tasked with analyzing a data set of Pyber's ride and driver data, allready divided by city. With this data I will use matplotlib functions, pandas functions like group by, loc, and others to clean and analyze and produce good looking graphs do determine the next steps for the company.

The purpose of the new analysis is well defined. (3 pt)

In the chart featured above, we can come to the conclusion that in the given timeframes there is a steady revenue stream, with the urban market generating more than 9 times more than the rural market and the suburban market twice as much as the rural market. 
As seen in the table below, the rural market is being utilized far less, 5 times less then the suburban market and 30 times less then the urban one, with its fare prices being one fifth more expensive than the suburban fares and a third more than the urban farer. One can come to the conclusion that the rural market has a lower supply and a higher demand than the other two, not given however, is the profits created back to Pyber with each ride, so a conclusion of incentivizing drivers to head towards rural areas could lead to higher driver turnover, dropping overall profits.
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
