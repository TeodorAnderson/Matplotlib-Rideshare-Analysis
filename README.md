# Matplotlib Rideshare Analysis
### Teodor Anderson


## Overview of the analysis:
  I have been tasked with analyzing a data set of Pyber's ride and driver data, allready divided by city. With this data I will use matplotlib functions, pandas functions like group by, loc, and others to clean and analyze and produce good looking graphs do determine the next steps for the company.

## Results

In the chart featured above, we can come to the conclusion that in the given timeframes there is a steady revenue stream, with the urban market generating more than 9 times more than the rural market and the suburban market twice as much as the rural market. 
As seen in the table below, the rural market is being utilized far less, 5 times less then the suburban market and 30 times less then the urban one, with its fare prices being one fifth more expensive than the suburban fares and a third more than the urban farer. One can come to the conclusion that the rural market has a lower supply and a higher demand than the other two, not given however, is the profits created back to Pyber with each ride, so a conclusion of incentivizing drivers to head towards rural areas could lead to higher driver turnover, dropping overall profits.

## Summary

1. With the lower supply and higher demand in the rural cities, a study could be done to see if with more incentives to have drivers serve that marked, profits could be increased due to their higher fares
2. The rural market ihas the lowest ratio of registered drivers per rides, if the study is completed, driver turnover in urban and suburban cities could be decreased by; incentivizing more rural coverage or lowering overall prices to increase traffic on our service to supply a steady revenue stream to our drivers
3. Providing the data analysts with a year by year data set with these studies and their changes could provide a much cleared picture of how these implementations and trends overall look
